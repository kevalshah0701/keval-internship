   <b> AJAX </b>is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages. <br><br>

   <b> AJAX </b>allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of
    data with the server behind the scenes. <br><br>
    
    This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading 
    the whole page.<br>
