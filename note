    1) while - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true
    
    2) do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true
    
    3) for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times

    4) foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array
